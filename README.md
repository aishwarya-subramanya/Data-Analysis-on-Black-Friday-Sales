# Data-Analysis-on-Black-Friday-Sales

In this analysis, we make use of our chosen dataset i.e. BlackFriday dataset. The main theme of our analysis is to perform basic data exploration to get an insight into the data and irregularities. Also, mainly to come up with the statistical inferences of the numerical as well as categorical variables. Along with this, the target variable would be graphically plotted with other variables in the dataset to describe the relationship between the same.

To predict the value of Purchase, a Linear Regression model would be built and root mean squared values are predicted.
